# Naive Bayes Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use the Naive Bayes classifier to predict survival from the Titanic dataset.

## Contents
- Python implementation of Naive Bayes classification.
- Data preprocessing and analysis.
- Visualization and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle: [Titanic Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file))
